= Simple Gradle

This is a rough little sample project that shows how to generate a config file and use it.

It does everything by hand (no Gradle plugin) and has a `build.gradle` file (not a `.kts` file).

== Usage

1. Check out the main TypedConfig repository.
2. Run `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal`. This is because TypedConfig isn't published yet.
3. Run `./gradlew run` in this directory (`samples/simple-gradle/`). This uses the Gradle Application plugin and will generate the config code, compile it (along with the sample application), and run the main method.

== Interesting files

* link:config.tc.toml[config.tc.toml]
* link:build.gradle[build.gradle]
* link:src/main/kotlin/Application.kt[Application.kt]
* `build/generated-sources/com/example/GeneratedConfig.kt` (after running once)
